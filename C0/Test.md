# Messing with Github
Testing to see if I can make a folder in the Github repo. I have already gone ahead and connected git and the repo on Github with SSH.
## SSH Help
- Stack Overflow is really helpful when issues arise
- It was nice that I already had SSH key pairs, so I didn't need to make a new set
- Github docs are also very nice, the tutoral skips one small bit and that's to make sure the Github key matches what pops up in your terminal
## Folders Help
- You need to do a git add of the file and folder at the same time
- Same for editing a file which I'm practicing with right now
