# Messing with Github
Testing to see if I can make a folder in the Github repo. I have already gone ahead and connected git and the repo on Github with SSH.
## SSH Help
- Stack Overflow is really helpful when issues arise
- It was nice that I already had SSH key pairs, so I didn't need to make a new set
- Github docs are also very nice, the tutoral skips one small bit and that's to make sure the Github key matches what pops up in your terminal
## Folders Help
- You need to do a git add of the file and folder at the same time
- Same for editing a file which I'm practicing with right now
## Comments
This is pretty specific, but I notice that when I do the git log, any changes done through the Github page shows the no reply email since it's private, but in git it gives the email I attached with the "global" command. Also, in the git history there is are verified vs unverified(?) changes. I wonder what that's about. 
## Questions
1. How would you delete files in Git? It seems easy to do through Github, but there's got to be a simple way. Maybe one simply deletes the file or folder in question and then pushes it to Github?
2. Can you create empty folders like on a computer?
